This C++ program simulates a simple bank account management system. It allows the user to check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw funds. The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can choose actions such as viewing the balance, making deposits, or withdrawing money. It includes input validation for deposits and withdrawals, ensuring that only valid transactions are processed. The program repeatedly prompts the user until they choose to exit. The balance is displayed with two decimal places for precision. Functions are used for deposit, withdrawal, and displaying the balance.
