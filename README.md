This C++ program simulates a simple bank account system, allowing the user to view the balance, deposit money, or withdraw money from their account. Here's an overview of the main features:

Key Functions:
deposit():

This function prompts the user to input an amount to deposit.
If the entered amount is greater than zero, the deposit is valid, and it returns the amount to be added to the balance.
If the amount is zero or negative, it returns 0 and prints an error message.
withdraw(double balance):

This function prompts the user to input an amount to withdraw.
If the withdrawal amount exceeds the current balance, it prints an "insufficient funds" message and returns 0.
If the amount is less than 0, it prints an error message and returns 0.
Otherwise, it returns the withdrawal amount to deduct from the balance.
showbalance(double balance):

This function displays the current balance of the account, formatted to two decimal places using std::setprecision(2) and std::fixed.
Main Loop:

The main loop allows the user to interact with the system by choosing from four options: showing balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, or exiting.
After each operation, it clears the input buffer and asks the user for another action until they choose to exit.
Observations & Suggestions for Improvement:
Input Validation:

The program includes some input validation (e.g., checking if the deposit or withdrawal amount is valid). However, in some cases, such as when invalid data is entered (non-numeric), the program might crash or misbehave. To prevent this, you could add checks for valid input using std::cin.fail().
Example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
if (std::cin.fail()) {
    std::cin.clear();  // Clear the error flag
    std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');  // Discard invalid input
    std::cout << "Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\n";
}
Using fflush(stdin):

The use of fflush(stdin) is not standard practice for clearing the input buffer. Instead, you can use std::cin.ignore() to discard invalid characters from the input buffer.
Negative Deposit/Withdrawals:

In the deposit and withdraw functions, if the user enters a negative amount, the program displays an error message and does not change the balance. This is good practice, but you may want to ask the user to re-enter a valid amount rather than proceeding with invalid input.
setprecision:

The std::setprecision(2) and std::fixed in the showbalance function ensure that the balance is always displayed with two decimal places. This is good for displaying money values, as it avoids showing too many decimal places.
Conclusion:
This program implements a basic banking system with the ability to view balance, deposit, and withdraw funds. It is functional but could benefit from better input handling and enhanced user experience (such as prompting for valid input if a wrong value is entered).
